## 👋 About Me

## 👋 About Me

I’m a Software engineer as a **Genesys Cloud CX Expert** currently working at **Orange Business Maroc**, where I lead and support complex **contact center migration projects** for international clients.  
My core responsibilities involve managing Genesys Cloud CX implementations and ensuring successful transitions from on-premise platforms.

While I have a background in **Java Spring Boot and Angular** from school and internship projects, I haven’t actively coded in the last two years.  
Currently, I **supervise fullstack development interns** on internal tools but focus more on coordination and architecture guidance than hands-on coding.

I’m now reigniting my technical foundations — especially **Java** and **Python** — as part of a long-term career shift toward **Cloud & DevOps Engineering**.


Alongside that, I manage technical interns, build internal tools (Dockerized Spring Boot apps on AWS), and act as project lead on core migration projects.

## 🔭 Vision

I'm now shifting my focus toward becoming a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer**,  
with the mission to:

- **Build a career that’s future-proof**, high-paying, and AI-resilient  
- **Work remotely or relocate** internationally to expand my growth  
- **Launch my own AA/AAA game studio**, funded by my main career income
